# Nemwel ZOO

Nemwel Zoo is a mobile web application that I built for my love for wild life. It features two pages: A home page and a Details page each with its own route.

The home page displays 10 random images displaying the name, animal type eg `Mammal` and its image. It also allows you to be able to click on an image to give you more information about that specific animal.

The details page is where all the information about a specific animal is displayed including its name, latin name, life span, habitats and so much more.

All the information is got from the [Zoo API](https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com) which is a free open source API.

Enjoy!
